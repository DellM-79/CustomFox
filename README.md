# Femifox
A Firefox 115-based fork that attempts to maintain functionality for Windows 7/8.x, as well as restore functionality for older Windows versions. Maintains compatibility with custom CSS themes like the ones that rely on Aero Glass.

Femifox will attempt to restore support for:
- Windows Vista/Server 2008 R1
- Windows XP/Server 2003
- Windows 2000/Server
- Windows 98/98SE/Me
- Windows NT 4.0
- Windows 95

Features that could be possible in the future:
- Native titlebars on Windows 10 and higher
- Support for Windows 3.x
